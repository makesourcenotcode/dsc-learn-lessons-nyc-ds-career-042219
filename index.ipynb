We saw that in Jupyter notebooks, we can either be in insert mode or escape mode. While in insert mode, we can edit the cells and undo changes within that cell with `cmd + z` on a Mac or `ctl + z` on Windows. In escape mode, we can add cells with `b`, delete a cell with `x`, and undo deletion of a cell with `z`.  We can also change the type of a cell to markdown with `m` and to Python code with `y`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we saw how to work with Python code in Jupyter notebooks.  We saw that to have our code in a cell executed, we need to press `shift + enter`. If we do not do this, then our variables that we assigned in Python are not going to be recognized by Python later on in our Jupyter notebook."
